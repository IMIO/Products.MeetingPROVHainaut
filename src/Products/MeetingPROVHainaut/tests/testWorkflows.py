       WARNING:
       The Plone test system seems to be bugged: it does not seem to take into
       account the write_permission and read_permission tags that are defined
       on some attributes of the Archetypes model. So when we need to check
       that a user is not authorized to set the value of a field protected
       in this way, we do not try to use the accessor to trigger an exception
       (self.assertRaise). Instead, we check that the user has the permission
       to do so (getSecurityManager().checkPermission)."""
